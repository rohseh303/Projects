Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user runs a logic simulation. The logic simulation runs a series of logic gates with the given input from the user and outputs a variety of values. In part A of the lab, a hexidecimal value is returned corresponding to the input of four bit inputs, which are either on or off. In part B of the lab, four bit inputs are entered and expects the logic simulation to output three independent bit inputs that follow the given truth table for part B. In part C of the lab, the three right-most bit inputs are entered and expects the logic simulation to output one bit input that follow the given truth table for part C. Part C has three parts: each part outputs the same bit value as each other but are constructed using different logic gate combinations. While the first part of part C uses the Product of Sum/Sum of Products, the second logic gate combination uses the Product of Sum/Sum of Products with only NAND gates. Lastly, the third logic gate combination implements the Product of Sum/Sum of Products using only NOR gates.

Lab1.lgi

This file runs and contains the logic simulation. It includes the logic gate constructs for each part of the lab and displays the outputs of the logic simulation programs.

INSTRUCTIONS

The application Multimedia Logic is used to run the logic simulation program and requires a virtual machine called Wineskin Winery for MacOS users.
